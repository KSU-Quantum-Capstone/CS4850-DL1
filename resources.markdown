# Online Quantum Computing Resources

This section consists of a handful of resources that were helpful to us to learn quantum computing and Qiskit. We hope that you will find these just as elucidating as we did. Many thanks to those who made these available to the public.

## Free Resources

[IBM Quantum Lab User Guide](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/)<br>
[Learn Quantum Computation Using Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/)<br>
[Qiskit Documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)<br>
[Qiskit Textbook (beta)](https://qiskit.org/learn/)<br>
[Quantum Computing For The Very Curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc)<br>

## Paid Resources

[Practical Quantum Computing: Asynchronous Workshop](https://ksu-quantum-capstone.github.io/CS4850-DL1/ws/)<br>
Note: we are not affiliated at all with this workshop, but it was helpful for us in learning more about quantum computing.
