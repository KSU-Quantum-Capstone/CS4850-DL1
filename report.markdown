# CS4850 Report

For our class, we were tasked to create a report which details our development process. This can be viewed below.

{% for report in site.static_files %}

{% if report.path contains "DL1-M2-FinalReport.pdf" %}

<object data="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}{{report.path}}" width="850" height="1100" type='application/pdf'/>
</object>

{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
